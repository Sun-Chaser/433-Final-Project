    <h1>This is A Phishing website!!!</h1>
    <h2>Hi! This is Jack Yang, Edgar Palomino, and Xinshi Feng from CSE 433 Computer Security. This website is our final project and no information has been disclosed (we make sure that). If you are interested, please read the following instruction about a phishing website</h2>

    <h2>Phishing Attack</h2>
    <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack that involves tricking individuals into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.</p>
    <p>Phishing attacks typically occur through email, social media, or instant messaging, where attackers create fake websites or emails that appear legitimate to deceive users into entering their personal information.</p>
    <p>Phishing attacks can take various forms, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> Attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to be from reputable sources, such as banks or online services, asking recipients to click on malicious links or provide sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> A targeted form of phishing where attackers customize their messages to a specific individual or organization, often using personal information to increase credibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Whaling:</strong> A type of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals, such as executives or senior management, with the goal of stealing sensitive corporate information.</li>
        <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Voice phishing, where attackers use phone calls to trick individuals into revealing personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> SMS phishing, where attackers send text messages containing malicious links or requests for sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Clone Phishing:</strong> Attackers create a nearly identical copy of a legitimate email that the victim has previously received, replacing the original link with a malicious one.</li>
        <li><strong>Angler Phishing:</strong> Attackers use social media platforms to impersonate customer service accounts, tricking users into providing personal information or clicking on malicious links.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Email Compromise (BEC):</strong> Attackers impersonate a trusted business partner or executive to trick employees into transferring money or sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Credential Harvesting:</strong> Attackers create fake login pages to capture usernames and passwords when users attempt to log in to legitimate services.</li>
        <li><strong>Pharming:</strong> Attackers redirect users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones without their knowledge, often by exploiting vulnerabilities in DNS servers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To protect against phishing attacks, individuals and organizations should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be cautious of unsolicited emails or messages, especially those requesting sensitive information.</li>
        <li>Verify the sender's email address and look for signs of phishing, such as poor grammar or suspicious links.</li>
        <li>Use two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security to accounts.</li>
        <li>Keep software and security systems up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Educate employees about phishing tactics and how to recognize them.</li>
        <li>Use anti-phishing tools and browser extensions to help identify and block phishing attempts.</li>
        <li>Regularly monitor accounts and financial statements for any unauthorized transactions.</li>
        <li>Report phishing attempts to the appropriate authorities or organizations.</li>
        <li>Use strong, unique passwords for different accounts and change them regularly.</li>
        <li>Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments, especially from unknown sources.</li>
        <li>Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords.</li>
        <li>Educate users about the importance of not sharing personal information over email or social media.</li>
        <li>Implement email filtering and security measures to detect and block phishing emails.</li>
        <li>Regularly back up important data to protect against ransomware attacks that may result from phishing.</li>
        <li>Encourage users to report suspicious emails or messages to IT or security teams for further investigation.</li>
        <li>Conduct regular security awareness training to keep users informed about the latest phishing tactics and trends.</li>
        <li>Implement a clear incident response plan to address phishing attacks and minimize their impact.</li>
        <li>Use domain-based message authentication, reporting, and conformance (DMARC) to help prevent email spoofing.</li>
        <li>Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against phishing websites and attacks.</li>
        <li>Regularly review and update security policies and procedures to address emerging threats.</li>
        <li>Encourage users to use secure connections (HTTPS) when accessing websites, especially when entering sensitive information.</li>
        <li>Monitor social media accounts for signs of impersonation or phishing attempts.</li>
        <li>Implement a zero-trust security model to limit access to sensitive information and systems.</li>
        <li>Use threat intelligence to stay informed about the latest phishing tactics and trends.</li>
        <li>Consider using machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect and respond to phishing attacks in real-time.</li>
        <li>Regularly review and update incident response plans to ensure they are effective against phishing attacks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By following these best practices and staying vigilant, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks.</p>
